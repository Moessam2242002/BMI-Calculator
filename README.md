# Instructions # BMI Calculator Exercise

## Problem Description
Create a Python program that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) and determines their weight category. The program should do the following:

1. Ask the user for their weight in kilograms and height in meters.
2. Calculate the BMI using the formula:
   
   BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2

3. Determine the weight category based on the BMI:
   - Below 18.5: Underweight
   - 18.5 to 24.9: Normal weight
   - 25 to 29.9: Overweight
   - 30 and above: Obese

4. Display the calculated BMI and weight category.
5. Optionally, suggest a target weight range for a "Normal weight" BMI.

## Testing
After implementing your solution, test it with different inputs to ensure it works correctly. Consider edge cases such as very low or high weights and heights.

## Extension Ideas with bonus
If you finish early or want to challenge yourself further, consider adding these features:

1. Input validation to ensure the user enters positive numbers for weight and height.
2. An option to input weight in pounds and height in feet/inches, converting to kg and meters for the calculation.
3. A visualization of the BMI scale and where the calculated BMI falls on it.
